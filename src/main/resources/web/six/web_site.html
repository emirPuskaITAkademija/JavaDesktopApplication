        <h3 id="headline">Here is a time line of scientist Nikola Tesla</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1870</strong>-Born in Croatia,Lika</li>
            <li><strong>1884</strong>-In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1888</strong>-With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up
                laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His
                alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse
                Electric, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase
                system which that company eventually marketed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1890</strong>- Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide
                wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York
                and Colorado Springs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1893</strong>- In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with
                his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower
                project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before
                he could complete it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1910s and 1920s</strong>-After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in
                the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a
                series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1943</strong>-He died in New York City in January 1943.</li>
            <li><strong>1960</strong>-Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when
                the
                General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his
                honor.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1990</strong>-There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
            <p>
                Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor.
                Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know more of this
                wonderful force".
            </p>
            <cite>-- Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry</cite>
